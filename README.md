# DNSInAppPurchaseManager
----
A simple In-App Purchase manager that handles the absolute basics of making an In-App purchase, and restoring a purchase which was already made. 

Note: This utility does not track the purchases itself, simply abstracts the making of the purchases. You will need to track what purchases the user has made in your application, either via the `SKReciept` or via saving 


## Installation

DNSInAppPurchaseManager is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "DNSInAppPurchaseManager"
